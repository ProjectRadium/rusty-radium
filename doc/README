Intro
-----
Radium is the base blockchain upon which all Project Radium decentralized services are built.
The main service built on top of Radium is the SmartChain.

SmartChain
----------
See https://github.com/JJ12880/SmartChain for more details on the SmartChain.

rusty-radium
------------
rusty-radium is the implementation of the radium core protocol in the Rust programming language.
rusty-radium will be continuously developed until the entire core protocol is implementated at a production level in versions 1.x.x.x.

rusty-radium development
------------------------
Once rusty-radium has reached production level support at versions 1.x.x.x and higher, development will be shifted from maintaining the core protocol, to implementing a new core protocol.
Periodic updates will be made in order to maintain the core protocol until the new core protocol is production ready.
